# CRUDWithNodeJs  
Node app using Express and MongoDb that implements a set of REST APIs allowing CRUD functionality for an employee resource. 
This app also has a test client for performing CRUD operations on employee database.

## Getting Started  

Download the project and run the following commands. We are using express as our web application framework, express-handlebars for test-client templates and mongoDb for storage.

**Installation**  
$ npm install  
This should install all required node modules

**Database Setup**  
The above installation should install mongoose and all other dependent modules.   
In case of issues, command for installing mongoose-  
$ npm install mongoose

Next, for starting mongo database server -   
Create a batch file with following commands and run it

cd C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.6.4\bin  
mongod.exe --dbpath C:\Users\Username\mongo-data

The above commands start mongoDb server and create a MongoDb Compass Community client  
1. Open the client and crerate a database called EmployeeDatabase  
2. Create a collection called Employees  

The above database will be used by our application  

**Launching the application**  
$node server.js  
This runs the startup script and starts the node server on port 3000.

This API has 2 endpoints  
1. http://localhost:3000/api/employees - Allows interaction with employees database for performing CRUD operations  
2. http://localhost:3000/employees - Provides a USER Interface/Test Client for this API
